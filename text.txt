I wasn't prepared for mandatory education. Emotionally. Socially. It's never the individual incidents that beat you; it's the persistance of them all. The constant belittling and derogatives that you try to ignore until eventually, you wake up years later, limited to a boundary of your own design, evocative of the same high school vignettes that you've experienced. You believe what they've told you all this time. You want to change but whatever habits you formed to survive remain. Maintaining (the status quo) is comfortable and the allure to fall back is always there. You make mistakes. You hesitate, you backstep, you wake up again and again and again, in the same place you were when you started. But, as long as you don't stay there, as long as you have the will to change things and push yourself to the limits, you'll find that - while you are the architect of your mental prison - you are also the best person to break out of it. And when you're outside of your cell, you'll find that the prison was as real as you made it.
